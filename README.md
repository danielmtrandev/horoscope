### Goal: Build a Simple Horoscope

This is my simple horoscope project! Users can input their birthday (month/day) and then receive a color horoscope based on their input.

### How It's Made:

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT

I made the basic styling and layout of the app via HTML and CSS. The main functionality of the app was made using Javascript.


### Optimizations:

I added additional styling to the fonts and images.


### Lessons Learned:

I would like to come back to this project and potentially add more different readings + color shades
